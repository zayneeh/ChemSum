# ChemSum

## Project Overview
The ChemEng Paper Summarizer is an NLP-based tool designed to facilitate the review of chemical engineering research papers. It automatically extracts and summarizes key sections such as the abstract, methodology, key findings, limitations, and safety considerations from chemical engineering papers. This tool aims to assist researchers, students, and professionals in quickly grasping essential insights without reading the entire text.

## Features
- **Automatic Summarization**: Extracts summaries, methodologies, key points, limitations, and safety information.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use web interface for uploading and analyzing documents.
